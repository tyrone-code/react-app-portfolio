          <h1>Hi i'm Tyrone Schoeman</h1>
          <p>I am a self-taught front-end web developer based in Krugersdorp Gauteng. I formally worked as a paralegal before switching careers to front-end web development. My goal is looking to become fullstack developer and then eventually specialize in backend development.</p>
      
<p>I have created three projects with foundational fundamental html, css and javascript which you can see at the <a href="#projects">project section.</a> The current portfolio website you are currently viewing is made with the react library.</p>      
<p>During my free time, I enjoy gaming and watching sports,  additionally, I love camping and have a deep appreciation for nature, often finding joy in hiking through its scenic beauty.</p>
<p>This website was crafted with the purpose of showcasing the projects and experiences I've been fortunate to be a part of. Currently, I am actively seeking new opportunities and connections, so please feel free to get in touch with me!</p>
